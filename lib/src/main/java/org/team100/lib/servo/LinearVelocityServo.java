 * usually relevant for wheeled mechanisms, where the surface speed of the wheel
 * is the important thing. Examples:
 * 
 * A conveyor belt drive is a wheel, but the important thing is the linear
 * movement of the belt.
 * 
 * A ball-shooter is a wheel, but the important thing is its surface speed.
